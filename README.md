### Hi there 👋

I am Georg Pernice. When I was 13 years old I started learning Python and developing little games and never really lost fun in coding. 
For my Bachelor Thesis at KIT I implemented a Reinforcement Learning agent using Keras and wrote a simulated environment in Python. 
After the Bachelor I did an internship at Bosch Engineering where I was able to learn a lot about their workflow in the development of Python tooling repositories, 
had first contact with Continuous Integration and was taught to write Unittests :D. Also I had some fun working in a team of three students there in the end.
Now I chose Mechatronics as a Master to represent better my desire for coding. 
I also enjoy playing music on piano/guitar/violin or going into nature.
