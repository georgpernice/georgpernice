### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Georg Pernice. Already when I was 13 years old I started learning Python and developing little games. (Later in C++ as well.)
For my Bachelor Thesis at KIT I implemented a Reinforcement Learning agent using Keras and wrote a simulated environment in Python.
Now I chose Mechatronics as a Master to represent better my desire for coding. I also enjoy playing music on piano/guitar/violin or going into nature.
